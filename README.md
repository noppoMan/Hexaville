Hexaville - The Serverless Framework using AWS Lambda + ApiGateway etc as a back end.

It's the greatest motivation to help many Swift and mobile application developers with rapid server side development and low cost operation.

### Supported Cloud Servises

* AWS Lambda(Node.js v8.10 runtime) + APIGateway
